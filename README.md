Daily Expenses Detector
Overview
The Daily Expenses Detector is a simple Python application designed to help users track their daily spending. It allows users to input expenses by category, amount, and description, and then stores this data in a CSV file. Additionally, it provides options for viewing expenses for the current day and analyzing spending by category. The application uses tkinter for the user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the tool through a graphical window.

Key Features:
Add Expense: Users can input details about their expenses, including category, amount, and a short description.
View Today’s Expenses: Displays all expenses recorded for the current day, including the total amount spent.
Expense Analysis: Summarizes the total spending for each category, helping users to understand their spending habits.
Data Storage: All expenses are saved in a CSV file for future reference, so users can track their spending across multiple days.
Application Structure
The application is divided into the following components:

1. Expense Entry Form
The user can input:

Category: Specifies the type of expense (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment).
Amount: The amount spent for that particular expense.
Description: A brief description of the expense (e.g., "Lunch at restaurant").
After the user enters these details, they click the "Add Expense" button to save the information.

2. View Today’s Expenses
The user can click the "View Today's Expenses" button to see all expenses recorded for the current day. The app retrieves the data from the CSV file and displays each expense with its description, amount, and category, as well as the total sum of all expenses for the day.

3. Analyze Expenses
The "Analyze Expenses" button gives the user a breakdown of their spending by category. The app calculates the total amount spent in each category and displays this summary to the user.

4. Data Storage
All expenses are saved in a CSV file (expenses.csv) in the following format:

Date,Category,Amount,Description
2024-10-23,Food,15.50,Lunch
2024-10-23,Transport,5.00,Bus fare
This allows for easy data export and review over time.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the application.
tkinter: A built-in Python library used to create the graphical user interface (GUI).
CSV Module: Used to handle storage of expenses in a CSV file format.

How to Use the Application?
Install Python: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your machine. Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python installations.
Run the Application: Download or clone the project from GitHub. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the script:

python daily_expenses.py

Add an Expense: Enter details for your expense (category, amount, and description) and click "Add Expense".
View Today’s Expenses: Click the "View Today’s Expenses" button to view your daily spending.
Analyze Expenses: Click the "Analyze Expenses" button to see a category-wise breakdown of your spending.


Future Enhancements
Data Visualization: Add charts (e.g., pie charts or bar graphs) to visually represent the spending data.
Database Integration: Replace CSV storage with an SQLite database for better data handling.
Expense Filtering: Allow users to filter expenses by date range.
Multi-user Support: Enable the application to support multiple users with separate expense records.
